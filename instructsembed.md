To use the <button id="0001-1_button" class="listbutton" style="display: inline-block">Show embed code</button> buttons for any of these images in another website the following must be put into the html file once.
```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue"></script>
<script src="https://ncsu-libraries.github.io/iiif-annotation/dist/iiif-annotation.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://ncsu-libraries.github.io/iiif-annotation/dist/iiif-annotation.css">
```

After this an many embed codes can be used in the html page.
