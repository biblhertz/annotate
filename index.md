**This application will no longer be supported starting 2/23/20. [https://annonatate.herokuapp.com](https://annonatate.herokuapp.com) has been built to replace it and is now running.**

Annotations can be viewed and created by toggling the <i class="fa fa-comments" aria-hidden="true"></i> button on the top left of the viewer.

New objects can be loaded by hovering over <i class="fa fa-th-large fa-lg fa-fw"></i> and choosing "<i class="fas fa-sync-alt"></i> Replace Object" and putting the url to the manifest in the "Add new object from URL" input box (i.e. https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/0052574/manifest.json)
