This application allows for hosting your own images and annotating them. This is really only necessary if there is no URL to the image you would like to annotate. The steps to do this are below.

1. Copy image into `assets/images/custom` folder.
2. Go to [{{site.baseurl}}/imageditor]({{site.baseurl}}/imageditor) page. Your new image should be listed.

**Note** High quality images will have slower performance when using the storyboard. This is due to the lack of tiling which IIIF provides. If you would like to make your images IIIF compliant the tools listed below try to lower the barrier to do so.
