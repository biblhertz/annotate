This section has instructions on how to create a GitHub pages site, how to run the server locally, how to create annotations, how to use the embed code, etc.

If you fork this site and want to get rid of this content, delete the `help` folder.

* 'Quickstart' gives instructions on how to run the annotation server locally. All steps after this are for deploying or serving the annotations. All the other pages are optional. You do not need to follow these steps if you are planning on deploying the Flask server to Heroku.
* 'Creating Annotations' gives instructions on how to create annotations through the Mirador interface
* 'How to user "embed code"' explains how to use the embed code on other websites.
* 'Creating GitHub website' gives instructions on how to host GitHub website through GitHub pages
* 'Deploying to Heroku' gives instructions on how to deploy the Flask server to Heroku. It assumes that the Jekyll site is going to be deployed to GitHub pages. If this is done you will not need to follow the instructions for 'Running Locally'
